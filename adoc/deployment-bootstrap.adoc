== Bootstrapping the cluster

Bootstrapping the cluster is the initial process of starting up the cluster
and defining which of the nodes are masters and which workers. For maximum automation of this process
{productname} uses the caaspctl package.

=== Preparation

==== Install caaspctl

First you need to install caaspctl on your local workstation:

. Add the SLE15 SP1 extension containing caaspctl. This also requires the "containers" module.
+
----
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-containers/15.1/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p caasp/4.0/x86_64 -r <Registration Code>
----
. Install caaspctl:
+
----
sudo zypper in caaspctl
----

=== Cluster Deployment

Make sure you have added the SSH identity (corresponding to the SSH key distributed above) to the ssh-agent on your workstation.
This is a requirement for caaspctl (https://github.com/SUSE/caaspctl#prerequisites).

[TIP]
====
The `ssh-agent` process is usually started automatically by most UNIX
environments. If that's not the case, invoke the `ssh-agent` command
and follow the guidance given by the tool's output.

You can load as many keys as you want into your agent using the
`ssh-add <path to key>` command. Keys can also be password protected.

You can list all the identities loaded into the agent by using the
`ssh-add -L` command.

caaspctl will try all the identities loaded into the ssh-agent until one of
them grants access to the node.

It is also possible to forward the authentication agent connection from a
host to another one. This can be useful if you intend to run caaspctl on
a "jump host" and don't want to copy your private key to this node.

This can be achieved using the `ssh -A` command. Please refer to the man page
of ssh to learn about the security implications of using this feature.
====


. Now you can initialize the cluster on the deployed machines.
As `--control-plane` enter the IP/FQDN of your load balancer. If you do not use a load balancer use your first master node.
+
----
caaspctl cluster init --control-plane <LB IP/FQDN> my-cluster
----
`cluster init` generates the folder named `my-cluster` and initializes the directory that will hold the configuration for the cluster.
. Switch to the new directory.
. Now bootstrap a master node.
For `--target` enter the IP address of your first master node.
Replace `<NODE NAME>` with a unique identifier for example "master-one".
+
[WARNING]
====
The directory created during this step contains configuration files that allow full administrator access to your cluster.
Apply best practices for access control to this folder.
====
+
----
cd my-cluster
caaspctl node bootstrap  --user sles --sudo --target <IP/FQDN> <NODE NAME>
----
This will bootstrap the specified node as the first master in the cluster.
The process will generate authentication certificates and the `admin.conf` file that is used for authentication against the cluster.
The files will be stored in the `my-cluster` directory specified in step one.
. Add additional master nodes to the cluster.
+
Replace the `<IP/FQDN>` with the IP for the machine.
Replace `<NODE NAME>` with a unique identifier for example "master-two".
+
----
caaspctl node join --role master --user sles --sudo --target <IP/FQDN> <NODE NAME>
----
. Add a worker to the cluster.
+
Replace the `<IP/FQDN>` with the IP for the machine.
Replace `<NODE NAME>` with a unique identifier for example "worker-one".
+
----
caaspctl node join --role worker --user sles --sudo --target <IP/FQDN> <NODE NAME>
----
. Verify the nodes that you added
+
----
caaspctl cluster status
----
+
The output should look like this:
+# instance user name
username = "sles"
----
NAME         OS-IMAGE                              KERNEL-VERSION        CONTAINER-RUNTIME   HAS-UPDATES   HAS-DISRUPTIVE-UPDATES
master-one   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1   4.12.14-110-default   cri-o://1.13.3      <none>        <none>
worker-one   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1   4.12.14-110-default   cri-o://1.13.3      <none>        <none>
----

=== Using kubectl

You can install and use kubectl by installing the kubernetes-client package from {caasp_repo_url}.

[TIP]
====
Alternatively you can install from upstream: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/.
====

To talk to your cluster, simply symlink the generated configuration file to `~/.kube/config`.

[source,bash]
----
ln -s ~/clusters/my-cluster/admin.conf ~/.kube/config
----

Then you can perform all cluster operations as usual. For example checking cluster status with either:

* `caaspctl cluster status`
+
or
* `kubectl get nodes -o wide`
+
or
* `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`
+
[source,bash]
----
# kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
